# The Guardian

A short RPG game where you play as a guardian who prevents the dead from entering the world of the living.

## 🎮 Overview

The dead souls possess inanimate objects such as mannequins and lanterns. Destroying them only slows them down because another soul repossesses those objects. 
You must close the dimentional gates from which those sould are entering in order to stop them. Good luck Guardian.

## 🛠 Development Notes
